# AI in Healthcare: A Learning Journey

Welcome to my project repository, where I document my journey in exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and healthcare. My primary goal is to master the application of machine learning (ML) techniques for medical diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment to contribute to advancing healthcare solutions. This README outlines the roadmap I'm following, shares resources, and invites collaboration from those interested in the field.

## Project Goal

To acquire a deep understanding and practical skills in applying AI and ML to healthcare, specifically focusing on:

-   Developing models for accurate medical diagnosis.
-   Creating systems for prognosis to predict disease progression.
-   Designing AI-driven recommendations for treatment plans.

## Learning Roadmap

### 1. **Foundation**
